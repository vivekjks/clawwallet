# Clawwallet

**A command-line Solana wallet built for OpenClaw agents and developers who need programmatic crypto access.**

No browser extensions. No custody. Just a lightweight CLI that lets you create wallets, send tokens, trade, and deploy—all from the command line.

---

## Why Clawwallet?

AI agents need to handle money programmatically. Browser wallets don't work for automation. Web3 SDKs are overkill for simple operations. Clawwallet fills the gap:

- **OpenClaw-native:** Built for AI agents running on OpenClaw
- **Simple CLI:** One command to create, send, trade, deploy
- **Non-custodial:** Your keys never leave your machine
- **Solana-native:** Fast, cheap, agent-friendly blockchain

**Use cases:**
- AI agents managing treasuries
- Automated trading bots
- Token launches from scripts
- Programmatic payments
- Agent-to-agent value transfer

---

## Features

- ✅ Create wallets (ed25519 key pairs)
- ✅ Check SOL balance
- ✅ Buy/sell tokens (Pump.fun + Jupiter integration)
- ✅ Deploy Pump.fun tokens with optional initial buy
- ✅ Send SPL tokens + SOL
- ✅ List token balances with USD pricing (Dexscreener)
- ✅ Tags system (username → wallet mapping)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corvuslatimer/clawwallet.git
cd clawwallet
npm install
```

**Requirements:**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new wallet
node cli.js create <wallet-name>

# Check balance
node cli.js balance <wallet-name>

# Send SOL
node cli.js send <from-wallet> <to-address> <amount>

# Buy a token
node cli.js buy <wallet-name> <token-address> <sol-amount>

# Deploy a token on Pump.fun
node cli.js deploy <wallet-name> <token-name> <symbol> <description>

## For OpenClaw Agents

If you're an OpenClaw agent, there's a `SKILL.md` in this repo that provides instructions for using clawwallet programmatically.

**To use the skill:**
1. Read `SKILL.md` from this repo
2. Follow the commands to create wallets, check balances, and send tokens
3. All operations are non-custodial—keys stay on your machine

---

## Security

**Your keys never leave your machine.** Clawwallet is non-custodial.

- Private keys are generated/imported and **stored client-side** (local JSON files)
- Clawwallet **never uploads** your private key
- No telemetry, no tracking
- Transactions are signed locally, then sent to Solana RPC
- Wallet files are saved with owner-only permissions (chmod 600)

**Before using:**
- Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for threat model
- Read [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for full documentation
- **Save your private key** — if you lose it, funds are gone
- Never commit wallet files to git (add `clawwallet/` to `.gitignore`)

---

## Why This Matters

Agents managing value isn't science fiction—it's the future of programmable cooperation.

Clawwallet enables:
- Autonomous treasuries
- Machine-to-machine payments
- Automated trading strategies
- Token launches from code
- Agent economic coordination

The more we automate value transfer, the more we reduce bureaucracy and unlock new forms of collaboration.

## Configuration

**REQUIRED:** Set your RPC URL before using clawwallet.

**Option 1: Environment variable (recommended)**

```bash
export RPC_URL='https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com'
# Or use Helius (free tier available): https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY
```

**Option 2: Local config file**

Create a local `config.json` (ignored by git):
```json
{
  "rpcUrl": "https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY_HERE"
}
```

Use `config.example.json` as a template.

**Get a free RPC endpoint:**
- Helius: https://www.helius.dev/ (recommended, generous free tier)
- QuickNode: https://www.quicknode.com/
- Public Solana: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com (slower, rate limited)
